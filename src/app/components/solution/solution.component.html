  <h1>The Solution</h1>
  <p>
    Imagine a snap on helmet mirror that addresses all of the limitations existing bike mirrors have, such as: Vibration; A multitude of adjustments to suit all riders; An easy snap on/ snap off format;
    A novel marking system which allows for quick reconfiguring if required on a new ride; AND; The ability to see from any position on the bike a rider might have. e.g.,
    from standing to more aero dynamic positions – all without having to readjust the previous set mirror system! Post both the ”full” video (https://youtu.be/Q5ixT0NUhtg) and the “short” video presentation (https://youtu.be/u-Fv4qYQiMY) AND, the sell sheet pdf.

    This patent pending system is currently in advanced proto-type stages now, with Beta testing underway, yielding very positive results!
    Biking needs to be made safer for bicyclists everywhere and the Mantis Mirror System can help do that!
