      <h1>The Solution</h1>
      <p>
        Imagine a snap on helmet mirror that addresses all of the limitations existing bike mirrors have, such as: Vibration; A multitude of adjustments to suit all riders; An easy snap on/ snap off format;
        A novel marking system which allows for quick reconfiguring if required on a new ride; AND; The ability to see from any position on the bike, a rider might assume e.g.,
        from standing to more aero dynamic positions â€“ all without having to readjust the Mantis Mirror System!
      </p>
      <p>
        This patent pending system is currently in advanced proto-type stages now, with Beta testing underway, yielding very positive results!
        Biking needs to be made safer for bicyclists everywhere and the Mantis Mirror System can help do that!
